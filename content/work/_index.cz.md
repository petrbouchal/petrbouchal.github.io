## Consulting work

*Ongoing*

Office of the Government, CZ (2021-ongoing): developing dataset of public finance data for estimating the impact of EU funds on the economy; analysis of public finance data to understand the role of EU funding in public spending.

I also work on non-technical topics (governance, policy making) with [České priority / Czech Priorities](https://ceskepriority.cz/), a nonprofit working to strengthen evidence-based decision making in the Czech public sector.
