### Surviving data analysis: an evaluator's gentle introduction to R (in English only)

8 June 2021, [Czech Evaluation Society Conference](https://czecheval.cz/cs/Konference/Konference-CES-2021), online

[worshop page with all materials coming](https://petrbouchal.xyz/czecheval2021)

This workshop is for those overwhelmed with piles of Excel files and “who knows how Alice did this calculation last year in data-final-v2-fin.xlsx” situations. It is also aimed at those who have been gathering up the courage to start programming with data or generally would like to up their data game.

- It will introduce the R programming language and provide a teaser of tools that evaluators will find most handy: project organisation, data input, data transformation and visualisation, accessing and using data from official sources, creating maps and building reproducible reports. You will get your first try of handling data in R and pointers to resources for learning further.
- You will receive instructions for (easy) technical setup before the workshop but you won’t need to install any software on your machine to take part in the workshop.
- No prior knowledge of R or programming is required. If you attended the [R data analysis workshop](https://petrbouchal.xyz/eval2020) at the 2020 MMR Evaluation conference, this will cover similar ground, with more focus on real-life applications. If you know a bit of R or used it way back in university, this will get you up to date on the R toolkit.
