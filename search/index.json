I do data analysis and create tools for better, evidence-informed governance.\nThematically, I am interested in public finance, urban governance and public strategy generally. Methodologically, I am broadly based as an analyst and policy evaluator with a preference for mixed methods research.\nTechnologically, I work mostly in R with a strong focus on data analysis workflows suited to the reality of evidence use in public service and civil society. I work with all sorts of data - public open data, geospatial, administrative, statistical. I am also very interested in the communication of empirical evidence, especially data visualisation.\nI make packages for using open data in R, create (experimental) data dashboards, and do my own analysis of public open data as well as consulting work.\n","href":"/","title":"index"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":""},{"content":"","href":"/bio/","title":"Bio"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"Coming soon.\n","href":"/software/","title":"Software"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"R packages  {statnipokladna}: using Czech public finance data in R {czso}: discovery and use of data from the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) {pragr}: use Prague\u0026rsquo;s open geospatial data  Quick experimental dashboards  czechtrack tracking selected Czech public finance time series covid tracking selected data for COVID-19 in the Czech Republic  Analysis of public sector data (work in progress)  Obce COVID-19 simulating the impact of Covid-related economic shocks on local public finance Czech public service in numbers looking at the Czech public sector workforce, updating preview work with Petr Janský  Consulting projects Schola Empirica (2020): transitioning the organisation\u0026rsquo;s data analysis team to state-of-the-art reproducible workflow using custom-built package {reschola} with document templates, custom visual themes and project templates.\nMinistry of Regional Development CZ (2020): preparing core data on EU subsidies for analysis, incl. extensive data checking and transformation using administrative open data and geospatial and text analysis.\nPing me at pbouchal \u0026laquo;at\u0026raquo; gmail \u0026laquo;dot\u0026raquo; com to discuss your project!\nApplied analysis These are some publicly accessible examples of my work done various employers over the years.\nPrague Institute for Planning and Development\n Prague\u0026rsquo;s finances in international and national comparison (2020) - lead author of 2 parts, using open budget data (Státní pokladna) Core Spatial Analytics Report (Územně analytické podklady, forthcoming) - lead author of data analysis on Prague\u0026rsquo;s public finances (time series analysis, comparison, visualisation)  Ministry of Regional Development\n Analysing the role of EU funds in public spending (esp. investment) (2017)  Institute for Government\n Whitehall Monitor (2012-15) co-creator of project assessing performance of UK public sector through visualisation and data journalism Financial Leadership in Government (2013) co-author of report on financial management in UK government  IDEA at CERGE-EI:\n Public servants: who are they, where do they work, how much do they earn?
