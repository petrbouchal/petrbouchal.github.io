[{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"  tl;dr: some stats agencies use the ISO standard to number weeks for data with weekly frequency. This has some funny implications, some of which cannot be handled with base R on some systems nor with {lubridate}. Use {ISOweek} for now.\nThis is one of those posts written for future me - though I suspect it might be useful to more people as we see more use of mortality data which this problem relates to.\nI have been working with statistical data on mortality. These are often reported with weekly intervals, e.g. by Eurostat and hence most European stats agencies. The time periods are labelled using strings like “2020-W23”.\nlibrary(dplyr) library(lubridate) library(czso) Here is data from the Czech Statistical Office:\nczso::czso_get_table(\u0026quot;130185\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% select(hodnota, vek_txt, roktyden, casref_do) %\u0026gt;% slice_head(n = 5) # # A tibble: 5 x 4 # hodnota vek_txt roktyden casref_do # \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dttm\u0026gt; # 1 9 0-14 2011-W01 2011-01-09 00:00:00 # 2 55 15-39 2011-W01 2011-01-09 00:00:00 # 3 457 40-64 2011-W01 2011-01-09 00:00:00 # 4 1151 65-84 2011-W01 2011-01-09 00:00:00 # 5 577 85 a více 2011-W01 2011-01-09 00:00:00 In plots, I wanted to label the axis with actual dates since few people know when exactly week 23 begins. I also needed to join some daily data with actual dates on them to weekly data with dates like “2020-W23”, so I used some floor_date() and make_date() and isoweek() magic from {lubridate}.\n(The data above has a start and end date for each week period, but since I also needed to join and summarise data from multiple years, I needed to work with the week periods at particular stages of the analysis so that the data would align correctly across years).\nThis worked fine, until 2021. With the first weekly data of 2021, I found out the hard way that in the ISO standard, 1 Jan 2021 belongs to week 53 of 2020. (This is because of some logic where which year a week falls into is determined by which day the year breaks at.) That means that you cannot easily construct a normal date from a “YYYY-WNN” string. Even if you can derive an ISO week from a date (isoweek() + isoyear()), you cannot derive a date from a year-week string (and a weekday).\nIt turns out there is a POSIX date format string, \"%V\", which would allow us to parse such dates, but this is unsupported in {lubridate}.\nparse_date_time(\u0026quot;2020-W53-1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%G-%V-%u\u0026quot;) # should return a date in 2020 # Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): Unknown formats supplied: GV parse_date_time(\u0026quot;2020-W53-7\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%G-%V-%u\u0026quot;) # should return a date in 2021 # Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): Unknown formats supplied: GV And it quietly returns NA in base R (strptime()).\nstrptime(\u0026quot;2020-W53-1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%G-%U-%u\u0026quot;) # should return a date in 2020 # [1] NA strptime(\u0026quot;2020-W53-7\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%G-%U-%u\u0026quot;) # should return a date in 2021 # [1] NA It does work in format(), but that won’t solve our problem.\nformat(as.Date(\u0026quot;2020-12-28\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;%G-W%V\u0026quot;) # should be in ISO wk 53 of 2020 # [1] \u0026quot;2020-W53\u0026quot; format(as.Date(\u0026quot;2021-01-03\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;%G-W%V\u0026quot;) # ditto # [1] \u0026quot;2020-W53\u0026quot; format(as.Date(\u0026quot;2021-01-04\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;%G-W%V\u0026quot;) # should be ISO week 1 of 2021 # [1] \u0026quot;2021-W01\u0026quot; Solution: {ISOweek}.

(I am not sure how much of the functionality is new or just redesigned.)\nThe result forms part of the {vsezved} package, which is an R gateway to the public register of schools in the Czech Republic.\nNote: as far as I can tell, this is legitimate use of the data source, but obviously please do not go and bombard the server with hundreds od massive search queries.\nThe data, the website The data source contains a school register. The data is located behind this antique-looking form. The bit we want - for a Covid-19-related project - is contact information for each of the country’s several thousand primary and secondary education institutions, as well as some metadata about the type of school, who established it etc.\n The path to the data The thing we want is not to scrape the massive paginated table we get from the search form, but to download the “Excel” (more on that later) export you can get after you run the search query. Unfortunately that is hidden behind two layers of forms and is itself downloaded by submitting one of four forms in the last layer.\nThe whole thing is written in some ASP/.Net tools I do not understand - all I can tell from inspecting the requests in browser developer tools and from trying to replicate those requests in curl, httr and in simple rvest steps is that the whole thing is held together by a bunch of cookies and session logics which the client needs to keep track of and return exactly, otherwise the server throws errors.\n The rvest workflow {rvest} to the rescue. One set of tools inside {rvest} that I previously ignored is the session-based workflow - which happens to solve exactly this problem. I started playing with it just as Hadley was doing some improvements and refactoring, so here is my understanding of how it works currently (it is now in the dev version on Github but probably soon on CRAN):\nlibrary(rvest) Start a session using session():  sess \u0026lt;- session(\u0026quot;http://stistko.uiv.cz/registr/vybskolrn.asp\u0026quot;) sess ## \u0026lt;session\u0026gt; http://stistko.uiv.cz/registr/vybskolrn.asp ## Status: 200 ## Type: text/html ## Size: 23117 This is an rvest_session object but can also be approached as a html_document. E.g. you can extract a form from it:\nExtract the form  form1 \u0026lt;- html_form(sess) The benefit of having the session object is that you can use it to submit the form, and all the right cookies will be automatically submitted with it.\nNote that we added a user agent header to identify ourselves.\nFill the form  But first, we need to set the values in the form - as it turns out, the defaults for this particular form, as seen in the browser, are not actually encoded in the HTML, so even if we want to submit a blank “give me everything” search, we need to manually set the defaults. (The object returned by html_form() is a list of rvest_form objects, which we nead to bear in mind when inspecting it.)\ne.g. let’s look at a particular field:\nform1[[1]][[\u0026#39;fields\u0026#39;]][[\u0026#39;uzemi\u0026#39;]] ## \u0026lt;field\u0026gt; (select) uzemi: and see its value (normally that would be the default):\nform1[[1]][[\u0026#39;fields\u0026#39;]][[\u0026#39;uzemi\u0026#39;]]$value ## character(0) So to set the values in the form, we need to have a look at what the first option is and set that as the value.\nform1[[1]][[\u0026#39;fields\u0026#39;]][[\u0026#39;uzemi\u0026#39;]][[\u0026#39;options\u0026#39;]][[1]] ## [1] \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot; That turns out to be the case for most of the select fields, so we can set it like so:\nform1set \u0026lt;- html_form_set(form1[[1]], # set to a small region so we don\u0026#39;t blast the # server with heavy queries uzemi = \u0026quot;CZ0514\u0026quot;, # the rest are defaults (\u0026quot;NOTHING\u0026quot;) zrizovatel = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, organ = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, typ = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, jazs = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, delka = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, forma = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, jazob = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, skupobor = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, kmobor = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;, obor = \u0026quot;NIC\u0026quot;) Submit the form, using the session  session_after_form1 \u0026lt;- session_submit(sess, form1set, submit = NULL, httr::user_agent(\u0026quot;github.com/petrbouchal\u0026quot;)) ## Submitting with \u0026#39;XX\u0026#39; session_after_form1 ## \u0026lt;session\u0026gt; http://stistko.uiv.cz/registr/skolyrn.asp ## Status: 200 ## Type: text/html ## Size: 33316 Now if we look at the results page in browser dev tools, we will see that the way to proceed to the export page is to submit another form:\nresults_forms \u0026lt;- session_after_form1 %\u0026gt;% html_form() length(results_forms) ## [1] 14 results_forms[1] ## [[1]] ## \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026lt;unnamed\u0026gt;\u0026#39; (POST http://stistko.uiv.cz/registr/vybskolrn.asp) ## \u0026lt;field\u0026gt; (submit) AA: Návrat na výběr results_forms[2] ## [[1]] ## \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026lt;unnamed\u0026gt;\u0026#39; (POST http://stistko.uiv.cz/registr/exportqx.asp) ## \u0026lt;field\u0026gt; (submit) EX: Export do Excelu Fourteen forms on a simple results page…\nThe text suggests the second form is what we want - it’s a single button, so we submit it.

It is also aimed at those who have been gathering up the courage to start programming with data or generally would like to up their data game.\n It will introduce the R programming language and provide a teaser of tools that evaluators will find most handy: project organisation, data input, data transformation and visualisation, accessing and using data from official sources, creating maps and building reproducible reports. You will get your first try of handling data in R and pointers to resources for learning further. You will receive instructions for (easy) technical setup before the workshop but you won’t need to install any software on your machine to take part in the workshop. No prior knowledge of R or programming is required. If you attended the R data analysis workshop at the 2020 MMR Evaluation conference, this will cover similar ground, with more focus on real-life applications. If you know a bit of R or used it way back in university, this will get you up to date on the R toolkit.

I currently serve as a member of the board of the Czech Evaluation Society.\nTechnologically, I work mostly in R with a strong focus on data analysis workflows suited to the reality of evidence use in public service and civil society. I work with all sorts of data - public open data, geospatial, administrative, statistical. I am also very interested in the communication of empirical evidence, especially data visualisation.\nI make packages for using open data in R, create (experimental) data dashboards, and do my own analysis of public open data as well as consulting work.\n[See complete CV]\n See the Czech blog if the below listing does not show what you expect.\n","href":"/","title":"index"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":""},{"content":"","href":"/bio/","title":"Bio"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"Coming soon.\n","href":"/software/","title":"Software"},{"content":"Consulting work Ongoing\nOffice of the Government, CZ (2021-ongoing): developing dataset of public finance data for estimating the impact of EU funds on the economy; analysis of public finance data to understand the role of EU funding in public spending.\nI also work on non-technical topics (governance, policy making) with České priority / Czech Priorities, a nonprofit working to strengthen evidence-based decision making in the Czech public sector.\nI am currently unable to take on larger projects.\nCompleted\nSchola Empirica (2020): transitioning the organisation\u0026rsquo;s data analysis team to state-of-the-art reproducible workflow using custom-built package {reschola} with document templates, custom visual themes and project templates.\nMinistry of Regional Development CZ (2020): preparing core data on EU subsidies for analysis, incl. extensive data checking and transformation using administrative open data and geospatial and text analysis.\nLearning and development / Training I am available to design and deliver training in data analysis (mostly R), data visualisation, open data/data governance and related topics, including comprehensive programs to help teams transition to more effective ways of working with data and empirical evidence.\nYou might be interested in these examples of talks and trainings (in Czech) that I have delivered recently.\nR packages  {statnipokladna}: using Czech public finance data in R {czso}: discovery and use of data from the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) {pragr}: use Prague\u0026rsquo;s open geospatial data {vsezved}: use open and not so open data on Czech schools (\u0026ldquo;registr škol\u0026rdquo;)  Quick experimental dashboards  czechtrack tracking selected Czech public finance time series covid tracking selected data for COVID-19 in the Czech Republic  Analysis of public sector data (work in progress)  Obce COVID-19 simulating the impact of Covid-related economic shocks on local public finance Czech public service in numbers looking at the Czech public sector workforce, updating preview work with Petr Janský  Pro bono Česko.digital: Učíme online (2021): data integration and analysis supporting operations and evaluation of volunteers helping schools with remote instruction.
